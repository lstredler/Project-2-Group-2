Project 2 Proposal 

Team Members: Thomas Westerkamp, Melissa Mongrella, Domenic Padulo, Lauren Stredler

- Brief articulation of your chosen topic and rationale 
	- We are going to analyze (at least) two data sets that contain information around COVID-19 cases across the U.S. More specifically, total cases by population, new deaths, hospital patients, etc. as well as the number and percentage of people who have been vaccinated. 
- Our rationale behind this is we can do a wide range of different visualizations with a wealth of data around different variables - i.e. new cases  per million, new deaths, etc. We also like that we can use the lat and long from the Kaggle data set to create a map with markets (see figure 1 below). 
- A link to your data set(s) and a screenshot of the metadata if it exists
	- https://www.kaggle.com/peretzcohen/us-vaccine-tracker 
	- https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data   
- A sketch of the final design
	- uploaded separately
- A link to the primary GitHub repository 
	- https://github.com/lstredler/Project-2-Group-2.git 
- 3 or 4 screenshots of relevant “inspiring” visualizations that frame your creative fodder
	- uploaded separately
